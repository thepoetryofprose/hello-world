# hello-world
New to git, learning along with the tutorial, my first repository
#
Initially, I am learning how to navigate git. This is analogous to the development and production environment where I work, just called different names and far more autonomously controlled. Needless to say, this is a feature of the scale that git can work with and so I am stepping out of my little sandbox and into the real world :)
